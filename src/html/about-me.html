        <div class = "my-summary">Hi!  My name is Will Fehrnstrom and I was born and raised in California.  I'm now an undergraduate CSE Major at UCLA.
          In other words, my main pre-occupation is software design.  I blog on the side a little bit too,
          in case you're interested in that (In these times, the world changes so fast that it's important to do some reflecting).
          I love to camp, run, read, and make side-projects, but projects are the most challenging of the four, and so inevitably
          most of my time goes there.  I went to Miramonte High School. To contact me, click any one of the circle things to the left.</div>
